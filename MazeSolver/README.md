# Personal Project: Maze Solver

**Brief:**

This project allows a user to experiment with different path-finding algorithms by visualising/animating how different 
search algorithms seek a (perhaps optimal) route towards a goal (from a starting position) in a grid. This project was 
also used as a means to learn _React.js_ for creating web-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).

The user is able to select between different search algorithms:
1. Random Walk
2. Breadth-First Search
3. Depth-First Search
4. Dijkstra's Algorithm
5. A* Search
6. Greedy Best-First Search
7. Bidirectional Greedy Search

The user is able to place walls within the grid that the algorithms must account for, but more importantly, the user may 
generate mazes using different maze generation algorithms:
1. Random Generation
2. Horizontal Generation
3. Vertical Generation
4. Recursive Division Generation


**Project Goals:**

There were several goals to this project as a means for personal development:

1. Review previous concepts related to search algorithms: weighted search, unweighted search, heuristics, etc.
2. Learn new algorithms relating to maze generation.
3. Learn and practice web development with Javascript, namely by learning how to create good-looking interfaces and animations.
4. Practice the ability to visualise my work - previous projects are underwhelming in what they achieve due to the CLI.
5. Begin to learn and practice creating such interfaces with _React.js_.
